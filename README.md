# CS-JAVA-Project-SNHU
Final 2 projects for CS 320 class
Reflective questions for 8-2 Journal assignment;


1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
      -I like to ensure functionality by writing thorough the unit tests to validate the behavior of my code against requirements. The security is addressed by following practices I believe are the best, such as           input validation, use of secure libraries, implementing proper authentication and encryption methods, and regularly reviewing for the vulnerabilities.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
       -I like to interpret the users needs by gathering and analyzing requirements through user stories, feedback, and documentation. Then, those needs are translated into features and workflows, ensuring that the         program will provide the most intuitive and efficient experience aligned with user expectations as much as I am able to.

3. How do I approach designing software?
       -I typically will start by analyzing the requirements and defining the most clear objectives for the said software. I then like to try to create my own take on design documents, use diagrams ( like UML for           example) and select appropriate architectures and technologies to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance, while trying to keep the user experience at the forefront the most.
